LNT
===
0.4.2
=====

We did a really bad job of incrementing this number for years. Lots of changes!

0.4.1
=====

...

0.4.0
=====

* Major redesign of database schema, primarily for performance reasons.

  * New design allows for definition of independent "test suites" which define
    the exact kinds of test data that are stored in the database. This greatly
    increased LNT's utility for testing things other than just the LLVM
    test-suite.

0.3.0
=====

* Initial release.
